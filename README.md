# pstmeval

This package contains a collection of helper functions for evaluating the accuracy of single-cell trajectory inference methods. 
Currently, the functions are designed for linear trajectories only, but I plan on expanding this in the future.

You can install with `devtools::install_github("pknight24/pstmeval")`.
